# EasySubletUBC

### Project description:

**EasySubletUBC** is a sublet management web application that lets the students at the UBC campus create a sublet posting where they mention the residence type, expected rent, and other details relevant to sublessees. The application should ideally have a two side usage scenario, one for sublessors and one for sublessees, but for this project will only focus on the sublessors side of the story. The sublessors will be able to add, update and delete a posting on the platform. They will also be able to add attractive pictures related to their posting and view them in an extended viewer format. Additionally, the sublessors will also be able to filter the kinds of postings they wish to refer/edit based using a filter option. This app has a viability to be scalled to off campus properties and cover a wider user base, but for pilot reasons, a smaller pool of audience is ideal.
