### Legend

1. Sublet: A place eg room/apartment given on rent for a short period of time. 
2. Sublessor: A person who wishes to give their place on rent. 
3. Sublessee: A person who wishes to rent someone else's place.

### Project description:

**EasySubletUBC** is a sublet management web application that helps the sublessors and sublessess at the UBC Vancouver campus connect with each other and formalize a sublet contract. the application has two sides, sublessor and sublessee. This project only focuses on the sublessor's side of the story. EasySubletUBC allows the sublessors to create, delete and update a psoting on the website. They can also view their postings in user-friendly UI to confirm if they have added the correct information on their posting. 

Access EasySubletUBC here: https://subletapp.onrender.com

### Project task requirements:

##### Minimal requirements

1. The application must allow the sublessors to CREATE a sublet posting (sublessor)✅
2. The application must allow the sublessors to DELETE a sublet posting (Sublessor)✅
3. The applicaitn must allow the sublessors to VIEW the postings in a user-friendly dashboard view (Sublessor)✅  

#### Standard requirements
2. The application should display an image of the sublet (Sublessor and Sublessee) ✅
3. The application should allow the user to UPDATE the rent if they wish to change ✅
4. The application should allow the users to filter the kind of rooms they are looking for, eg room type (Sublessor and Sublessee) ✅
5. The application should allow the users to upload their own clicked photos and view them in a viewer ⚠️

#### Stretch requirements
2. The application could share their postings on social media (Sublessor)❌
3. The application could allow the user to favourite posting (Sublessee)❌
4. The application could allow the user to send an inquiry/message to the sublessor (Sublessee) ❌


**1. React**
   - Implemented a dynamic and user-friendly front-end interface for sublessors
   - Utilized component-based architecture for efficient management and updates of sublet postings
   - Employed React Router for seamless navigation between different sections of the application

     
**2. Redux**
   - Utilized Redux to maintain a centralized state for sublet postings, enhancing data consistency
   - Employed Redux Toolkit for efficient and standardized state management code
   - Reduced unnecessary API calls by fetching and storing data from the server in the Redux store

     
**3. Node & Express**
   - Utilized Node.js and Express to create a robust API for handling sublet postings
   - Organized API routes using routers to manage sublet creation, deletion, and viewing
   - Ran the application with both development and production modes for testing and deployment
   - Seamlessly integrated the Node & Express backend with the React/Redux frontend

     
**4. MongoDB**
   - Leveraged MongoDB to store sublet postings and associated information
   - Designed a structured database schema to efficiently manage sublet data
   - Utilized MongoDB's NoSQL capabilities to store flexible and varied sublet information
   - Enabled easy modifications of sublet data fields and values in the database

     
**5. Builds & Deployment**
   - Deployed the application on Render.com, a platform well-suited for MERN stack projects
   - Leveraged Render.com features, such as automatic scaling and zero downtime deployment
   - Utilized Git integration to set up automatic deployments from specific branches, ensuring smooth updates to the live application on each commit

### Above and Beyond Fucntionality
Considering the much less time I had as compared to other groups and also the fact that I working on the project alone, I would like to nominate two things for the above and beyond section.
1. Research on User Design - Researched about efficient design practices and created a seamless user design for the app. (interesting facts)
   “The visual distraction of clutter increases cognitive overload and can reduce the user’s working memory” - Dr. Tamara Munzner, ~ Researched by Parth Sehtiya
2. Filter by residence feature - helps the user filter listings based on the residence area they select. 


### Task breakdown:

#### Task 1: Create a listing on the website

- Go to the url for home page. 
- Click on Post on the top right corner.
- Fill out necessary posting details on the popup form.
- Click submit.
- View your posting on the dashboard.

#### Task 2: Delete a posting from the website.

- Go to the home page that says "My Postings"
- Look for a posting that you wish to delete.
- click on the delete button.
- click on the delete button on the popup to confirm the deletion.
- View the dashboard, but this time without the posting youjust deleted.

#### Next Steps (Future of this project)
- The next steps include wotking on the rest of the features and develop sublessee's side of the app.
- More features include the following
-   Upload photos (Standard)
-   Share on social media (Stretch)
-   View the posting (Sublessor's view) (Stretch)
-   Favourite a posting (Sublessor's view)(Stretch)
-   Send an inquiry (Sublessor's view)(Stretch)
-   Message the sublessor (Stretch)

External APIs could be used to incorporate more fucntionality as well as a script could be written to create a sublet pdf form contract for the sublessor and the sublessee.  

#### List of Contributions
Everything done by Parth Sehtiya, with reference from geeksforgeeks, stack overflow, MongoDB documentation, youtube videos and a some more resources available on the internet.
